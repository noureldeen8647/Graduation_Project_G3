Project Description:

The project involves using two ATmega 32 microcontrollers with UART communication protocol to create a smart home system. The aim of the project is to transform a traditional home into a smart home using information and communication technology to improve comfort, security, and energy efficiency.

The main components of the project include:

1. LDR and LED: A light sensor (LDR) and LEDs are used to create a smart lighting system. The sensor detects the light level in the room and adjusts it accordingly.

2. LCD: A liquid crystal display (LCD) is used to display important information such as temperature and the status of other home appliances.

3. Servo: A servo motor is used to control the movement of the main door. The door can be opened and closed using a keypad.

4. Stepper: A stepper motor is used to control the movement of the curtains. The curtains can be automatically opened and closed using a keypad.

5. DC: DC motors are used as fans to provide ventilation for the home.

6. LM35: An LM35 temperature sensor is used to measure the room temperature and control the heating and cooling system.

7. Keypad: A keypad is used for password input and to control the functions of the smart home.
